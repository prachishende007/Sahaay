# Sahaay - Your Voice For A Better City

**Project ID:** SIH25031  
**Hackathon:** Smart India Hackathon (SIH)

## Overview


**Sahaay** is a crowdsourced civic issue reporting and resolution system  that uses a simple PWA and an AI Triage Engine to bridge the communication gap between citizens and municipal authorities, making the process fast, transparent, and efficient.

This project was developed for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** and focuses on simplifying complex tasks with minimal user interaction.

---

## Features

- **One-Tap Report**: Users can report with a single tap.
- **Real-Time Detection**: Uses **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for object detection on live video streams.
- **Database Integration**: Predicted results are stored in a backend database for record-keeping and analytics.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Visualizes predictions and analytics, enabling efficient monitoring and decision-making.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design allows easy integration with other systems or models.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI 
- **Frontend:** React.js 
- **AI/ML:** YOLO (Real-Time Object Detection)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 
- **Deployment:** Docker
